# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Instead, please email **security@cactuscompute.com** with:

1. A description of the vulnerability.
2. Steps to reproduce the issue.
3. The potential impact.
4. Any suggested fixes (optional).

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and aim to provide a fix or mitigation plan within 7 days.

## Scope

This policy covers the Cactus inference engine, its SDKs (Python, Swift, Kotlin, Flutter, Rust, React Native), and the official model weights hosted on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/Cactus-Compute).

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied to the latest release. We recommend always running the latest version of Cactus.
